           A Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. <br /><br />

           <span class="point">When to Stop Turning Test:</span><br />
           The test is repeated many times. If the questioner makes the correct determination in half of the test runs or less.<br />
