           A Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. <br /><br />
           
           The original Turing Test requires <code>3</code> terminals, each of which is physically separated from the other two. One terminal is operated by a computer, while the other two are operated by humans. <br /><br />
           
           <span class="point">When to Stop Turning Test:</span><br />
           The test is repeated many times. If the questioner makes the correct determination in half of the test runs or less.<br />

The main goal was to map "human reason" and "process data" with semantic content. The main early results were fraud detection, medical diagnose and automating expert knowledge about specific domains.

          <h2>First-Order Logic (FOL)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>FOL is another way of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. It is an extension to propositional logic.</li>
            <li>FOL is sufficiently expressive to represent the natural language statements in a concise way.</li>
            <li>FOL is also known as Predicate logic or First-order predicate logic. First-order logic is a powerful language that develops information about the objects in a more easy way and can also express the relationship between those objects.</li>
            <li>FOL (like natural language) does not only assume that the world contains facts like propositional logic but also assumes the following things in the world
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="text-highlight">Objects: </span>A, B, people, numbers, colors, wars, theories, squares, pits, wumpus, etc.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-highlight">Relations: </span>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="text-highlight">It can be unary relation such as:</span> red, round, is adjacent,</li>
                            <li><span class="text-highlight">n-any relation such as:</span> the sister of, brother of, has color, comes between</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="text-highlight">Function: </span>Father of, best friend, third inning of, end of, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="lead">As a natural language, first-order logic also has two main parts:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Syntax</li>
            <li>Semantics</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Syntax of First-Order logic</h2>
        <p class="lead">The syntax of FOL determines which collection of symbols is a logical expression in FOL. The basic syntactic elements of FOL are symbols. We write statements in short-hand notation in FOL.</p>

            <h2>Quantifiers in First-order logic:</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A quantifier is a language element which generates quantification, and quantification specifies the quantity of specimen in the universe of discourse.</li>
                <li>These are the symbols that permit to determine or identify the range and scope of the variable in the logical expression.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="lead">There are two types of quantifier:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-highlight">Universal Quantifier: </span>for all, everyone, everything.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="text-highlight">Existential Quantifier: </span>for some, at least one.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Universal Quantifier:</h4>
            <p class="lead">Universal quantifier is a symbol of logical representation, which specifies that the statement within its range is true for everything or every instance of a particular thing.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">If x is a variable, then ∀x is read as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For all x</li>
                <li>For each x</li>
                <li>For every x</li>
            </ul>
            
            <span class="text-highlight">Example:</span>
            <p>All man drink coffee:</p>
            
            <p>Let a variable x which refers to a cat so all x can be represented in UOD as below:</p>
            
            <div>
                <img src="images/first-order-logic-in-artificial-intelligence2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            
            <code>∀x man(x) → drink (x, coffee).</code><br>
            <p>It will be read as: There are all x where x is a man who drink coffee.</p>
            
            
            <h4>Existential Quantifier:</h4>
            <p class="lead">Existential quantifiers are the type of quantifiers, which express that the statement within its scope is true for at least one instance of something. <br>
            
            It is denoted by the logical operator ∃, which resembles as inverted E. When it is used with a predicate variable then it is called as an existential quantifier.
            </p>
            
            <p class="lead">If x is a variable, then existential quantifier will be ∃x or ∃(x). And it will be read as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There exists a 'x.'</li>
                <li>For some 'x.'</li>
                <li>For at least one 'x.'</li>
            </ul>
            
            <span class="text-highlight">Example:</span>
            <p>Some boys are intelligent.</p>
            
            <div>
                <img src="images/first-order-logic-in-artificial-intelligence3.png" alt="">
            </div>
            
            <code>∃x: boys(x) ∧ intelligent(x)</code><br>
            
            <p>It will be read as: There are some x where x is a boy who is intelligent.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-highlight">Points to remember:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The main connective for universal quantifier ∀ is implication →.</li>
                <li>The main connective for existential quantifier ∃ is and ∧.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 class="text-highlight">Properties of Quantifiers:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In universal quantifier, ∀x∀y is similar to ∀y∀x.</li>
                <li>In Existential quantifier, ∃x∃y is similar to ∃y∃x.</li>
                <li>∃x∀y is not similar to ∀y∃x.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="text-highlight">Some examples FOL using quantifier:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>All birds fly.</li>
                In this question the predicate is "fly(bird)."
                <br>
                And since there are all birds who fly so it will be represented as follows.
                <br>
                <code>∀x bird(x) → fly(x).</code>
                <br><br>
                <li>Every man respects his parent.</li>
                In this question, the predicate is "respect(x, y)," where x=man, and y= parent.
                <br>
                Since there is every man so will use ∀, and it will be represented as follows:
                <br>
                <code>∀x man(x) → respects (x, parent).</code>
                <br><br>
                <li>Some boys play cricket.</li>
                In this question, the predicate is "play(x, y)," where x= boys, and y= game. Since there are some boys so we will use ∃, and it will be represented as:
                
                <code> ∃x boys(x) → play(x, cricket).</code>
                
            </ol>
