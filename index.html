           A Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. <br /><br />

           <span class="point">When to Stop Turning Test:</span><br />
           The test is repeated many times. If the questioner makes the correct determination in half of the test runs or less.<br />

          <h2>First-Order Logic (FOL)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>FOL is another way of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. It is an extension to propositional logic.</li>
            <li>FOL is sufficiently expressive to represent the natural language statements in a concise way.</li>
            <li>FOL is also known as Predicate logic or First-order predicate logic. First-order logic is a powerful language that develops information about the objects in a more easy way and can also express the relationship between those objects.</li>
            <li>FOL (like natural language) does not only assume that the world contains facts like propositional logic but also assumes the following things in the world
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="text-highlight">Objects: </span>A, B, people, numbers, colors, wars, theories, squares, pits, wumpus, etc.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-highlight">Relations: </span>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="text-highlight">It can be unary relation such as:</span> red, round, is adjacent,</li>
                            <li><span class="text-highlight">n-any relation such as:</span> the sister of, brother of, has color, comes between</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="text-highlight">Function: </span>Father of, best friend, third inning of, end of, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="lead">As a natural language, first-order logic also has two main parts:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Syntax</li>
            <li>Semantics</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Syntax of First-Order logic</h2>
        <p class="lead">The syntax of FOL determines which collection of symbols is a logical expression in FOL. The basic syntactic elements of FOL are symbols. We write statements in short-hand notation in FOL.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A quantifier is a language element which generates quantification, and quantification specifies the quantity of specimen in the universe of discourse.</li>
                <li>These are the symbols that permit to determine or identify the range and scope of the variable in the logical expression.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="lead">There are two types of quantifier:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-highlight">Universal Quantifier: </span>for all, everyone, everything.

                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Universal Quantifier:</h4>
            <p class="lead">Universal quantifier is a symbol of logical representation, which specifies that the statement within its range is true for everything or every instance of a particular thing.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">If x is a variable, then âˆ€x is read as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For all x</li>

            <h4>Existential Quantifier:</h4>
            <p class="lead">Existential quantifiers are the type of quantifiers, which express that the statement within its scope is true for at least one instance of something. <br>
            
            It is denoted by the logical operator âˆƒ, which resembles as inverted E. When it is used with a predicate variable then it is called as an existential quantifier.
            </p>
            
            <p class="lead">If x is a variable, then existential quantifier will be âˆƒx or âˆƒ(x). And it will be read as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There exists a 'x.'</li>
                <li>For some 'x.'</li>

            <h4 class="text-highlight">Points to remember:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The main connective for universal quantifier âˆ€ is implication â†’.</li>
                <li>The main connective for existential quantifier âˆƒ is and âˆ§.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 class="text-highlight">Properties of Quantifiers:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In universal quantifier, âˆ€xâˆ€y is similar to âˆ€yâˆ€x.</li>
                <li>In Existential quantifier, âˆƒxâˆƒy is similar to âˆƒyâˆƒx.</li>
                <li>âˆƒxâˆ€y is not similar to âˆ€yâˆƒx.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="text-highlight">Some examples FOL using quantifier:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>All birds fly.</li>
                In this question the predicate is "fly(bird)."
                <br>
                And since there are all birds who fly so it will be represented as follows.
                <br>
                <code>âˆ€x bird(x) â†’ fly(x).</code>
                <br><br>
                <li>Every man respects his parent.</li>
                In this question, the predicate is "respect(x, y)," where x=man, and y= parent.
                <br>
                Since there is every man so will use âˆ€, and it will be represented as follows:
                <br>
                <code>âˆ€x man(x) â†’ respects (x, parent).</code>
                <br><br>
                <li>Some boys play cricket.</li>
                In this question, the predicate is "play(x, y)," where x= boys, and y= game. Since there are some boys so we will use âˆƒ, and it will be represented as:
                
                <code> âˆƒx boys(x) â†’ play(x, cricket).</code>

            In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well "labeled." It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher.

            <h4>What is Unsupervised Machine Learning?</h4>
            <p class="lead">
            Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. Instead, you need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.

                ðŸ”µ K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
                <br><br>
                ðŸ”µ K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
                <br><br>
                ðŸ”µ K-NN is a <span class="point">non-parametric algorithm</span>, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.
                <br><br>
                ðŸ”µ It is also called a <span class="point">lazy learner algorithm</span> because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.

                <span class="dark-text-highlight">Example: </span>
                Suppose, we have an image of a creature that looks similar to cat and dog, but we want to know either it is a cat or dog. So for this identification, we can use the KNN algorithm, as it works on a similarity measure. Our KNN model will find the similar features of the new data set to the cats and dogs images and based on the most similar features it will put it in either cat or dog category.

            <h4>Select Value of K in the KNN Algorithm</h4>
            <p class="lead">Below are some points to remember while selecting the value of K in the K-NN algorithm:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>There is no particular way to determine the best value for "K", so we need to try some values to find the best out of them. The most preferred value for K is 5.</li>
                <li>A very low value for K such as K=1 or K=2, can be noisy and lead to the effects of outliers in the model.</li>
                <li>Large values for K are good, but it may find some difficulties.</li>
            </ul>
